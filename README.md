ðŸš€ Project Showcase: Netflix Clone with HTML, CSS & JavaScript ðŸŽ¬

I recently built a Netflix Clone using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project helped me dive deep into front-end development and enhance my skills in creating dynamic user interfaces. Here's what I worked on:

âœ… Responsive Design: Developed a sleek, mobile-friendly UI with HTML and CSS, closely mimicking the Netflix look and feel.

âœ… Dynamic UI Elements: Used JavaScript to add interactive features like content carousels, hover effects, and modal pop-ups for a smooth user experience.

âœ… Search & Filtering: Implemented basic search functionality with JavaScript for browsing through movies and shows.

âœ… Media Grids & Layouts: Built clean layouts and media grids using CSS Flexbox for a seamless browsing experience across devices.

This project was a great way to refine my front-end development skills and explore the creative side of web design!
